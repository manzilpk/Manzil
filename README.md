## 🌆 About

**Manzil** (منزل — meaning *destination* in Urdu) is a travel and lifestyle app built to help people explore and experience the best their city has to offer. Whether you're looking for a quiet café to study at, a scenic viewpoint to unwind, or a budget-friendly hangout spot with friends — Manzil has you covered.

The platform combines **location-based discovery**, **social recommendations**, and **personalized suggestions** into one seamless experience. Users can filter places by mood, vibe, and budget, and the system learns from their preferences to serve better recommendations over time.

> Built as a Database Systems (CS220) project, Manzil is designed with a rigorously normalized PostgreSQL backend and a Spring Boot REST API layer.

## 🗄️ Database Design

### Entity-Relationship Model

The Manzil ER model captures 6 core entities, 1 weak entity, 4 associative entities, 2 subclasses, and 1 multivalued attribute — all mapped to a 13-relation relational schema using a systematic 8-step ER-to-Relational mapping process.

---

## 📐 Schema Overview

### Core Entities (7)

| Entity | Key Attributes | Relationships |
|---|---|---|
| **User** | user_id, email, password, activity_history | Recommendation (1:M), Place (M:M), Review (1:M) |
| **Place** | place_id, name, city, opening_hours, min_cost, max_cost, avg_rating | DiscountOffer (M:1), Vibe (M:M), Category (M:M), User (M:M) |
| **Review** | review_id, rating_score, comments, review_date, likes_count | User (M:1), Place (M:1) |
| **Category** | category_id, name, icon, description | Place (M:M) |
| **Vibe** | vibe_id, name, description | Place (M:M) |

### Weak Entity

| Entity | Identifying Entity | Composite PK |
|---|---|---|
| **PlaceImages** | Place | (Order, Place_ID) |

### Associative (Junction) Tables (3)

| Table | Resolves |
|---|---|
| **Bookmark** | RegisteredUser ↔ Place |
| **LikedPlaces** | RegisteredUser ↔ Place |
| **PlaceANDVibe** | Place ↔ Vibe |
| **PlaceCategory** | Place ↔ Category |

### Subclasses (2)

```
User
├── RegisteredUser  (preferences, join_date)
└── Admin           (role, permission)

DiscountOffer(Implementation in Future)
├── GroupDiscount        (min_group_size)
├── UniversityDiscount   (universityName, availableFor)
├── TimeBasedDiscount    (start_time, end_time)
└── PaymentDiscount      (payment_partner, cardType, cashback_amount)
```

### 8-Step ER-to-Relational Mapping

| Step | Type | Applied |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Regular Entities | 6 core tables created |
| 2 | Weak Entities | PlaceImages table with composite PK |
| 3 | 1:1 Relationships | None — skipped |
| 4 | 1:N Relationships | FKs added to Place, Review, DiscountOffer |
| 5 | M:N Relationships | 3 junction tables: LikedPlaces, Bookmark, PlaceANDVibe, UserANDRecommendation |
| 6 | N-ary Relationships | None — skipped |
| 7 | Multivalued Attributes | UserName relation extracted from User |
| 8 | Generalization | 6 subclass tables (User → 2, DiscountOffer → 4) |

---

## ✅ Normalization

All 13 relations satisfy **BCNF** — the highest standard of relational normalization.

| Normal Form | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **1NF** | ✅ Satisfied | UserName extracted to separate relation to eliminate composite multivalued attribute |
| **2NF** | ✅ Satisfied | No partial dependencies — all non-key attributes depend on the full composite key |
| **3NF** | ✅ Satisfied | No transitive dependencies — all non-key attributes depend directly on the PK |
| **BCNF** | ✅ Satisfied | Every determinant is a candidate key — no non-trivial FD violations |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- pgAdmin (optional, for GUI access)
- Maven

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/manzil.git
cd manzil

# 2. Create the PostgreSQL database
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE manzil;"

# 3. Run the schema SQL
psql -U postgres -d manzil -f db/schema.sql

# 4. (Optional) Seed sample data
psql -U postgres -d manzil -f db/seed.sql

# 5. Configure your database connection
# Edit src/main/resources/application.properties:
# spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/manzil
# spring.datasource.username=your_username
# spring.datasource.password=your_password

# 6. Build and run
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
